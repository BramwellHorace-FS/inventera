## Progress Check / Stand Up

Each week, I will summarize my milestone activity and progress by including a **Stand-Up**. A "stand-up" is when I take the time to briefly report out on the following...

1. **Accomplishments** - What I worked on this past week
2. **Challenges** - Any challenges I may have (and how I am addressing those challenges)
3. **Next Steps** - What I plan to prioritize and do next

**Week 1**: This week I researched to help complete some of the project requirements for this week. This included producing a project concept, creating a wireframe outlining the important features of the project, style tile, and project proposal. One of the challenges I faced was finding a concept for the project. I was a bit limited on time so I felt like I didn't spend enough time on research or brainstorming. I feel like my project concept isn't fully fleshed out. However, I was able to zero in on a concept that I not only have some experience with but also got some good input from other people. Moving into the next milestone, I will be sure to allocate more time to research and make sure the features I am proposing are clear and easy to understand.

**Week 2**: This week, I worked on the planning portion of my project. This work included creating a click-through prototype of the application, creating issues for things to get done, and planning out the API endpoints required for the application. The challenges I faced this week were understanding the type of relationships necessary for specific API tables. The other challenge was figuring out the proper way to set up junction tables associations with Sequelize. I've begun building out the API with Sequelize since I know it will take the most time. My plan moving forward is to continue this work and make improvements where I see fit.

**Week 3**: This week I learned how to set up ESLint and how to set up a React project with a node server. I also went over a few additional research topics to help me create the components for my application. The challenge for me this week was Heroku. I was unable to get things set up according to assignment requirements or deploy anything. I am a bit confused about what exactly I should be doing. I would need to reach out for more clarification. To move things forward, I will be sure to ask for some feedback and get more clarification on what I should be doing in this particular course.

**Week 4**:
