## How ESLint Makes Me a Better React Developer

This article was a great introduction to ESLint and how it can help you develop better React applications. ESLint is essentially a tool that analyzes your code intending to find issues that can lead to bugs or inconsistencies. By default, ESLint ships with a set of rules and best practices and will display red squiggly lines on your code if it finds any issues. Some of the rules are:

- **No duplicate keys on objects**
- **No unreachable code**
- **No unused variables**

In addition to these rules, you can also configure ESLint to use custom rules.
